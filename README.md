# Programming Foundations Lesson 2.2: Arrays

## Exercise 1

```js
let myNumbers = [13, -2, 18, 4, 42, 12, 9, -21, -3];
```

a) Console log out how many items the Array holds.

b) Remove the last item in the Array.

c) Add the number 14 to the end of the Array.

d) Add the number 3 to the start of the Array.

e) Use a for loop to go over the Array and find the larges number.

> Tip: Use a variable largest and compare every item to the largest, update largest if the item is larger.

## Exercise 2

Given the Array: 

```js
let vegetables = ['Cabbage', 'Turnip', 'Radish', 'Carrot'];
```

a) Console log out how many items the Array holds.

b) Add "Tomato" to the end of the Array.

c) Add "Cucumber" to the start of the Array.

d) Use a for loop to go over the Array, and for each item, console log out the value of the item and how many letters it contains (ie. "Tomato contains 6 letter").

## Exercise 3

Make an array with the first 10 Fibonacci numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34

Make a varaible sum.

Use a for loop to go over the array, and add up the value of the numbers.

Console log out the sum.

## Exercise 4
Given the array:

```js
let mixed = ["Dill", 42, true, , 13, "13", null];
```

a) Make a for loop to loop over all items and, for each item console log out the index, value and data type of the element.

b) Add the string "Hello, World!" to the undefined element in the Array `mixed`, then console.log out `mixed`.
